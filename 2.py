"""Design a class to find the kth largest element in a stream. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Implement KthLargest class:

KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer k and the stream of integers nums.
int add(int val) Appends the integer val to the stream and returns the element representing the kth largest element in the stream."""
